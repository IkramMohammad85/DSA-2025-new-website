        <h2>Comparison of Tax Liability of China Representative Office (RO) vs. Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE)</h2>
        <p>With this calculator you can calculate how much you can save in tax by switching from a Representative Office to a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise simply by inputting your annual expenses from financial year 2014.</p>

<form action="" method="GET">

  <table width="100%" class="mt-2 mb-3">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td><input type="number" class="form-control" id="expenses" name="expenses" placeholder="RO:  Expenses (RMB)"></td>
      <td><button type="submit" class="hp-asiapedia__btn btn btn-outline-primary">CALCULATE</button></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

</form>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In China, a Representative Office is a basic corporate structure which foreign companies use for market research, support and as a way to "get their foot in the door." They are cheap and quick to set up, but can't make profit and are heavily taxed on expenses. A Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise is a fully owned, fully incorporated entity that has more flexibility with their operations and can make a profit and generate revenue. WFOEs are liable to Business Tax on turnover and Corporate Income Tax on profits.</p>
        <h2>Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this calculator is to show that by switching from an RO to a WFOE, business owners can potentially save high amounts on their annual tax costs. Not all RO's will benefit from such a switch, only those that have high annual expenses. Because profit rates can be adjusted, the tax that a WFOE is liable for can be less than that of the inflexible structure of a RO.</p>
        <p>In our experience we have found that any Representative Office that has expenses of over RMB 1 million per annum would benefit from this conversion and could be cost effective after one year, even after taking into account the cost of the conversion process.</p>
        <p>For more information, and to schedule a detailed consultation on whether this switch is right for your business, please contact a Dezan Shira & Associates Representative by clicking <a href="https://www.dezshira.com/contact">here</a></p>
        <p>To find out what your potential savings are please input your RO expenses for 2014 (RMB) into the field above.</p>

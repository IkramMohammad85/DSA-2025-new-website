                    <p>Publication releases and all photos, videos and any other related multimedia assets
                        (collectively, the “Publication Content”) distributed by Dezan Shira &amp; Associates and its
                        subsidiaries and posted on our sites may be used for editorial use only, meaning news, factual,
                        educational, public interest, informational and/or historical purposes where a specific and
                        separate agreement with us provides for this permission. Publication Release Content may not be
                        used for commercial use, meaning advertising, marketing, merchandising, promotional or in any
                        way endorsing goods or services. Except as otherwise provided in these TOU or as otherwise
                        expressly permitted by Dezan Shira &amp; Associates in advance in writing, Publication Content
                        may not be republished, copied, streamed or redistributed without Dezan Shira &amp; Associates’
                        prior written consent. Where you have been granted written permission to make editorial use of
                        photographs, you must: (i) use each photograph only within the context of the news release with
                        which it was distributed; (ii) include any captions and/or text associated with each photograph,
                        including links, if required in the metadata; (iii) include the credit line set forth in the
                        metadata for each photograph, and if no credit line is included, then provide credit to “Dezan
                        Shira &amp; Associates,” in either case with such credit appearing immediately adjacent to the
                        News Release Content and in a clear and conspicuous manner comparable to the credit customarily
                        provided to licensors of similar content; (iv) if present, display the copyright notice included
                        in the metadata for each photograph; and (v) follow any other instructions contained in the
                        metadata for each photograph, including without limitation the term of any license period,
                        territory or media restrictions. In connection with editorial use of photographs, you may never:
                        (i) alter, rotate, manipulate, or crop the photograph in any manner that alters the editorial
                        integrity or essential nature of the photograph; (ii) use the photograph in any manner that is
                        obscene, pornographic, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable; or (iii) violate any laws,
                        regulations or industry codes of practice. Dezan Shira &amp; Associates is not responsible for
                        Publication Release Content in any way, including without limitation, any copyright, trademark,
                        publicity, privacy, contract or other rights clearance, or the accuracy, timeliness, integrity,
                        quality, safety, appropriateness or other aspect of any information or other content contained
                        therein. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of Publication
                        Release Content, and for determining if any permissions are necessary to use the Publication
                        Release Content, and, if so, for securing those permissions prior to your use of the Publication
                        Release Content. If you choose to rely on or otherwise use Publication Release Content in any
                        way you do so solely at your own risk and without any representation or warranty whatsoever from
                        Dezan Shira &amp; Associates, its affiliates or its service providers.</p>

                        Although we may make this material available, we do not in any way recommend, endorse or promote
                        it. If you have any complaints about the third-party material we make available, you should

                        offer on our part to sell any services. How you buy and use services will depend on separate
                        terms and conditions, and you may need to register with us or another organisation.</p>



                    <h2 class="text-start">Other matters</h2>

                    <p>If any court having the appropriate authority finds that any of these terms are not valid, this

	<h2 class="heading-level2">Registered Capital and Total Investment Calculators</h2>

	<p>Within the gap between Total Investment and Registered Capital, authorities allow for a capped loan amount to be arranged between an overseas creditor and the WFOE. Most commonly, WFOEs resort to a shareholder loan or to a loan granted by a related party, such as a company that is part of the same group as the parent. Yet the WFOE is also permitted to seek out a loan from a wider range of sources, such as loans from overseas governments, loans from overseas banks and financial institutions, loans from overseas enterprises and other kinds of international commercial loans.</p>


	<h3 class="heading-level3">OPPORTUNITY</h3>
	<p>Early on in the process of incorporating a WFOE, investors are faced with the critical task of deciding how much Registered Capital to commit to their company. Because overcommitted funds may become idle and delay profit repatriation - and running out of working capital puts the WFOE at risk of insolvency - the careful planning of Registered Capital commitments is necessary. For investors looking for the right balance between under-commitment and over-commitment of Registered Capital, the ability to fall back on company loans offers welcome flexibility.</p>

	<p>The purpose of these calculators is to provide investors with a tool to explore the option of utilizing company loans based on the statutory ratios between Registered Capital and Total Investment.</p>

	<p>Please note that these calculators were designed to provide an indicative assessment of the Loan to Total Investment ratio. Before making any decisions regarding Registered Capital and Total Investment, investors are advised to consult a professional financial advisor.
